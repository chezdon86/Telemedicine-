# My Telemedicine App

A simple, secure telemedicine landing website where patients can sign up, log in, and fill detailed medical profiles (including blood group, genotype, allergies, etc.). Doctors can view patient lists and profiles.

This is the static frontend prototype — built from scratch with HTML and CSS. Future plans: Add Firebase for real authentication, data storage, and doctor-patient sharing.
